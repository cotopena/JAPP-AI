## Professional Profile
AI and technology consultant with 10+ years of experience across software delivery, operations, and client-facing leadership. I design practical systems that connect business goals to technical execution in environments where teams, tools, and data are fragmented. My approach combines business discovery, technical architecture, and implementation ownership to deliver measurable outcomes.

## Target Role
AI and Technology Consultant (Job ID: 4087866005)

## Selected Case Work

### QuoteNclose - Algorithmic Pricing and Downstream Data Quality
- Problem: windows/doors quoting depended on fixed-size pricebooks with large coverage gaps across high-variation products.
- Approach: designed and implemented an algorithmic pricing model using fewer than 100 parameters to generalize across thousands of SKUs and customization combinations.
- Impact: achieved 99.99% pricing accuracy in production quote workflows; improved quote/contract data quality for sales, operations, and finance; helped reduce ordering, permitting, and delivery timelines by up to 3 weeks.

### SafeGuard Impact - Unified Operations and Growth Systems (Consulting Engagement)
- Problem: core departments were using disconnected CRMs/tools, causing information loss, poor handoffs, and inconsistent decision inputs.
- Approach: delivered three systems as a consultant: (1) unified source-of-truth database, (2) CPQ workflow with structured point-of-sale data capture and department-specific routing, and (3) referral partner application for circular lead generation.
- Impact: increased referrals by 300%; supported 20% monthly sales growth during referral-program rollout; increased operational efficiency by 50% through AI-assisted cross-department workflows.

### Reehash - Technology-Enabled Revenue Operations
- Led product strategy and software delivery for virtual sales workflows that improved consultation quality and channel performance.
- Increased client sales by 25% and reduced overhead by 50% through workflow redesign and implementation support.

### Earlier Commercial Execution Results
- Roof1303: closed first 83 online sales; coached team to 40% close rate versus approximately 20% benchmark.
- Mendiola Group: exceeded quota by 80%; helped scale annual sales volume from 300 to 6,000.
