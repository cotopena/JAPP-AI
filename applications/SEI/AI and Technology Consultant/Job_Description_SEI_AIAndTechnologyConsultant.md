About the job
Who We Look For

An SEI-er is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI-ers keenly understand how to adjust their support and problem solving based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, SEI-ers possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As super-connectors, they connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI-ers frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI-ers are ethical and trustworthy individuals who consistently and repeatedly follow through, and hold true to their values in difficult situations. SEI-ers have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others. As every project is different, an SEI-er must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. SEI-ers define ambition differently. They are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who truly enjoy one another- they like to hang out with colleagues outside of work, collaborate and hold one another accountable. SEI-ers enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends, and family.
