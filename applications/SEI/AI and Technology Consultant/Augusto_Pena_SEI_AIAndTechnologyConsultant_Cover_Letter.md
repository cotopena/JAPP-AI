**Re: AI and Technology Consultant (Job ID: 4087866005)**

Dear Hiring Team,

SEI's AI and Technology Consultant role aligns with how I deliver value: translate complex business needs into practical technical systems and lead execution across stakeholders from leadership to frontline teams. I bring a consulting mindset with hands-on delivery depth across solution design, application development, and operational change.

## Fit Highlights

- **QuoteNclose:** replaced fixed-size windows/doors pricebooks with an algorithmic pricing model (<100 parameters) that achieved 99.99% accuracy in production quote workflows and improved downstream planning for sales, operations, and finance.
- **SafeGuard Impact (Consulting Engagement):** delivered three systems that resolved cross-department fragmentation: a unified source-of-truth database, CPQ workflow, and referral partner app; outcomes included 300% referral growth, 20% monthly sales growth during rollout, and 50% operational efficiency improvement through AI-assisted workflows.
- **Cross-functional execution:** led early digital sales and CRM process transformation at Roof1303, revenue scale leadership at Mendiola Group, and structured waterfall-style project management at WeeklySpoon.

I am especially interested in SEI's model of combining high-accountability client delivery with internal participation and collaboration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to SEI's Miami engagements.

Sincerely,  
Augusto Pena
