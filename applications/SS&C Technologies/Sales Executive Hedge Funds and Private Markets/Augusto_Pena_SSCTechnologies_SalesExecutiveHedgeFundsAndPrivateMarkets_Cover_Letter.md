Re: Sales Executive Hedge Funds and Private Markets

Dear Hiring Team,

I am applying for the Sales Executive Hedge Funds and Private Markets role because it aligns with my background building and scaling B2B revenue across complex service and technology offerings. I have consistently exceeded sales targets, built new pipelines from zero, and developed long-term client relationships in competitive markets.

In my most recent operating and sales leadership roles, I built full-funnel prospecting motions, ran high-impact client presentations, and improved close rates through structured objection handling. At Mendiola Group, I helped grow annual sales from 300 to 6,000 and exceeded quota by 80%. At TOPO UAV, I drove 100% year-over-year growth while maintaining 90% retention and generating repeat business through consultative account management.

I am comfortable collaborating with subject matter experts to translate technical capabilities into business outcomes, whether in live client meetings, proposal discussions, or executive presentations. My MBA, Economics background, and early experience supporting financial planning and analysis work at Balboa Bank & Trust give me a strong foundation to quickly deepen further into SS&C's fund administration, transfer agency, and middle-office solutions for asset managers.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can help SS&C generate new asset management opportunities, guide prospects through the evaluation process, and win strategic mandates in hedge funds and private markets. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Augusto Pena
