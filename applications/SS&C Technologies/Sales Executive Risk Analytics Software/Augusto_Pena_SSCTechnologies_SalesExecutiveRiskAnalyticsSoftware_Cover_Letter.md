Re: Sales Executive Risk Analytics Software (R38082)

Dear Hiring Team,

I am applying for the Sales Executive Risk Analytics Software role because it aligns with my background in enterprise-style B2B selling, quota attainment, and consultative customer development. Across my sales leadership roles, I have consistently built pipeline, converted complex opportunities, and delivered measurable revenue outcomes.

At TOPO UAV, I drove 100% year-on-year growth while maintaining 90% client retention through disciplined prospecting, relationship management, and technical presentations. At Mendiola Group, I exceeded quota by 80% and helped scale annual sales from 300 to 6,000 by building a structured funnel, coaching managers, and improving close performance. At Roof1303, I helped close the first 83 online sales and built stronger CRM and forecasting discipline as the team scaled.

I bring a strong financial and analytical foundation through my MBA, Economics degree, and prior analyst experience at Balboa Bank & Trust supporting forecasting and budgeting under the CFO team. I am comfortable working in SME-supported sales motions where technical depth and business impact must be translated clearly for executive buyers.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can help SS&C Algorithmics expand new customer acquisition, strengthen territory performance, and contribute to revenue growth in North American financial risk software accounts.

Sincerely,
Augusto Pena
