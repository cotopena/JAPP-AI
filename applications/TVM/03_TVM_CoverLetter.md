# Cover Letter - TVM Application

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to submit my application for the Key Account Manager position at TVM. With a robust background in sales leadership, strategic account management, and a proven ability to drive revenue growth, I am confident in my capacity to expand TVM’s footprint within the Miami market.

Throughout my career, I have consistently exceeded sales targets through innovative strategies and exceptional relationship building. As Co-Founder and CEO of REEHASH.COM, I led the development of a virtual sales platform that increased contractor client sales by 25% through the effective use of AI-powered tools and tailored financing options. My experience as VP of Sales at Mendiola Group, INC further honed my ability to build and manage high-performing teams, while my role as Sales Executive & Sales Manager at ROOF1303.COM showcased my expertise in leveraging CRM systems to optimize the sales pipeline.

In addition to my corporate achievements, I bring valuable entrepreneurial experience from my involvement with Poke-Kai, a food truck venture where I invested in and managed the financing operations until its successful sale in 2022. I also recently provided consulting services for Concord Maintenance, where I developed and executed a client acquisition strategy that secured meetings with several major chain restaurants. These experiences have equipped me with a diverse skill set and a keen understanding of financial management, strategic planning, and client service—qualities that are directly applicable to the Key Account Manager role at TVM.

TVM’s innovative approach to digital media and its commitment to delivering premium advertising solutions resonate with my professional background and passion for driving results. I am eager to bring my expertise in face-to-face sales, negotiation, and CRM management to your team, and I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to TVM’s continued growth and success.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the prospect of joining TVM and contributing to your mission of enhancing visibility and engagement in high-dwell environments.

Sincerely,

Augusto Pena
