Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Commercial Account Manager position at Ramp. As someone who has dedicated my career to optimizing post-sale experiences, driving consistent revenue growth, and forging meaningful client relationships, I am captivated by Ramp’s mission to transform financial operations for businesses of all sizes. The idea of helping organizations save time and money resonates deeply with my own passion for leveraging technology to streamline processes.

My fascination with fintech innovations began while overseeing account retention and customer expansions at previous companies. I witnessed how crucial an intuitive platform can be for busy finance teams—and the difference it makes when users genuinely feel supported by their chosen solution. In my roles as Co-Founder at REEHASH.com and Sales Manager at ROOF1303, I successfully introduced new systems to clients, built multi-layered onboarding strategies, and consistently exceeded sales and retention targets. These experiences taught me the power of proactive account management, from understanding each customer’s financial workflow to anticipating their next potential challenge.

What draws me most to Ramp is its commitment to continuous improvement. Your track record—over $1B saved for 30,000+ companies—and recognition on Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies list signals a vibrant environment I am eager to join. With a solid background in CRM-driven growth, SaaS implementations, and B2B relationship-building, I can confidently step in to help expand Ramp’s SMB portfolio, drive adoption, and ensure customer satisfaction over the long term.

Thank you for reviewing my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience in growing revenue and fostering collaborative relationships can contribute to Ramp’s continued success. Please feel free to contact me at your convenience. I look forward to exploring how I can be a valuable asset to your team.

Sincerely,

**Augusto Pena**
