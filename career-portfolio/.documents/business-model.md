# Career Portfolio Website - Business Model

Last updated: 2026-02-19

## 1. Purpose
Build a high-credibility personal portfolio website that turns profile visitors into concrete career opportunities.

Primary outcomes:
- Increase interview requests for full-time roles.
- Increase inbound interest for contract or consulting work.
- Provide a single, clear URL that supports resumes, applications, and networking outreach.

## 2. Core Audience
Primary audience:
- Recruiters
- Hiring managers
- Founders and operators at growth-stage companies

Secondary audience:
- Potential collaborators
- Referral partners
- Professional network contacts

## 3. Value Proposition
The website should quickly answer three questions:
1. What does Augusto do best?
2. What measurable results has he delivered?
3. Why should someone contact him now?

Core value delivered to visitors:
- Fast understanding of profile and strengths.
- Evidence-based work history and project outcomes.
- Clear next step (book call, email, LinkedIn, resume download).

## 4. Product Definition
The product is a static portfolio website built with:
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `script.js`

Key components:
- Hero with positioning statement
- Experience timeline
- Project/case-study highlights
- Skills and tools section
- Contact call-to-action

## 5. Conversion Model
This is not a direct revenue SaaS product. Value is captured through career outcomes.

Primary conversion events:
- Contact initiated (email, LinkedIn, form, or direct message)
- Interview invitation
- Paid project inquiry

Secondary conversion events:
- Resume opened/downloaded
- Project links clicked
- Time spent on case-study sections

## 6. Distribution Strategy
Main channels:
- Resume links in job applications
- LinkedIn profile and posts
- Direct outreach messages
- Networking conversations and referrals

Optional channels:
- Personal domain SEO
- GitHub profile links
- Guest posts or community profiles

## 7. Content Strategy
Content must prioritize clarity and proof.

Rules:
- Focus on outcomes, not tasks.
- Use numbers where possible (revenue impact, growth, efficiency, conversion).
- Keep writing concise and skimmable.
- Keep tone professional and direct.

Content pillars:
- Career narrative (what problems are solved)
- Experience proof (results and wins)
- Project proof (what was built and why it mattered)
- Credibility assets (resume, references, external links)

## 8. Operating Model
Workflow for updates:
1. Capture new achievements in source docs.
2. Open ticket in `.documents/.tickets/current/`.
3. Create plan in `.documents/.plans/pending/`.
4. Implement content/UI changes in portfolio files.
5. Manually verify and publish.

Update cadence:
- Light updates: weekly
- Major updates: monthly or after significant career milestones

## 9. Success Metrics
Track success by month and quarter.

Top metrics:
- Interviews generated from portfolio traffic
- Qualified inbound opportunities
- Outreach reply rate when portfolio is included
- Time to first meaningful action on page

Quality metrics:
- Mobile usability
- Page readability and scanability
- Accuracy and freshness of achievements

## 10. Risks and Mitigations
Risk: Generic messaging with weak differentiation.
Mitigation: Lead with niche strengths and quantified outcomes.

Risk: Outdated content reduces credibility.
Mitigation: Set recurring review cadence and changelog updates.

Risk: Visual polish but weak conversion path.
Mitigation: Keep primary CTA visible and explicit across sections.

Risk: Too much detail creates friction.
Mitigation: Keep top-level summary short, link to deeper details only when needed.

## 11. Near-Term Roadmap
Phase 1:
- Tighten headline and positioning.
- Improve project cards with stronger outcomes.
- Ensure mobile layout quality and CTA clarity.

Phase 2:
- Add one polished case-study section.

- Improve performance and accessibility scores.

Phase 3:
- Add content modules for specific role types.
- Add tailored landing variants for target companies if useful.
