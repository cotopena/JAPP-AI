# Cover Letter — Primis

Dear Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for the Account Manager position at Primis. With over six years of SaaS account management experience driving customer adoption, renewals, and upsells—combined with a deep enthusiasm for AI/ML technologies—I am confident in my ability to deliver measurable growth and success for your customers.

At REEHASH, I built an AI‑enabled virtual sales platform that increased client revenue by 25% through strategic upsell campaigns and automated customer re‑engagement. My hands‑on experience managing full customer lifecycles—from onboarding and product demonstrations to contract renewals—has consistently resulted in retention rates above 90% and significant expansion of existing accounts.

I thrive in fast‑paced, collaborative environments and excel at translating complex technical solutions into clear business value. Partnering with engineering and product teams, I have guided customers through AI/ML use case discovery, optimized their workflows, and delivered training that boosted platform adoption by over 45%.

Primis’s mission to empower AI teams with observability and performance insights resonates deeply with my background. I am eager to leverage my account planning expertise, negotiation skills, and customer‑centric mindset to help Primis’s clients achieve success and scale their AI initiatives.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience can contribute to Primis’s continued growth.

Sincerely,
Augusto Pena
